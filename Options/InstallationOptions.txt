# OPENCMISS_USE_ARCHITECTURE_PATH
# -------------------------------
#
# Use architecture path to enable multiple configs in the same installation.
#
# .. default:: YES
OPENCMISS_USE_ARCHITECTURE_PATH;TRUE;BOOL;Use architecture path to enable multiple configs in the same installation.

##
# OPENCMISS_DEVELOP_ALL
# ---------------------
#
# Override any local variable and have CMake download/checkout the "develop" branch of any components repository
#
# See also: `<COMP>_DEVEL`_
#
# .. default:: NO
OPENCMISS_DEVELOP_ALL;FALSE;BOOL;Download/checkout development branches of all components of the OpenCMISS build.

##
# OPENCMISS_INSTALLATION_SUPPORT_EMAIL
# ------------------------------------
# 
# Please set this to your email address, especially if you plan to provide several architecture installations and
# expect people to use your installation
#
# .. default:: OPENCMISS_BUILD_SUPPORT_EMAIL
OPENCMISS_INSTALLATION_SUPPORT_EMAIL;developers@opencmiss.org;STRING;Please set this to your email address, especially if you plan to provide several architecture installations and expect people to use your installation.

##
# OPENCMISS_RELEASE
# -----------------
#
# Sets whether the current build is for making a tagged release.  This option effects the version number of the SDK package.  Not an option for general consumption, but for use in the release process.
#
OPENCMISS_RELEASE;FALSE;BOOL;Setting for determining if the built libraries are destined to become an official release.

# OPENCMISS_DISABLE_GIT
# ---------------------
#
# Disable use of Git to obtain sources.
# The build systems automatically looks for Git and uses that to clone the respective source repositories
# If Git is not found, a the build system falls back to download :code:`.zip` files of the source.
# To enforce that behaviour (e.g. for nightly tests), set this to :cmake:`YES`.
#
# .. caution::
#
#     If you want to switch from not using Git back to using Git, the update/download targets wont work
#     since the source folders are not empty and are also no Git repositories - the "git clone" command
#     is senseful enough not to simply overwrite possibly existing files. In this case, simply delete the
#     source directory :path:`<OPENCMISS_ROOT>/src` before switching. The next build will automatically
#     clone the Git repositories then.
#
# .. default:: NO
OPENCMISS_DISABLE_GIT;FALSE;BOOL;Do not use Git to obtain and manage sources.

##
# OPENCMISS_GITHUB_USERNAME
# -------------------------
#
# If you set a github username, CMake will automatically try and locate all the
# components as repositories under that github account.
# Currently applies to **all** repositories.
#
# .. default:: <empty>
OPENCMISS_GITHUB_USERNAME;;STRING;Specify you own username for retreiving repositories from.

##
# OPENCMISS_ZINC_ONLY
# -------------------
#
# Set this to true to only build the Zinc library.  OPENCMISS_IRON_ONLY and OPENCMISS_DEPENDENCIES_ONLY
# must be FALSE if this variable is set to TRUE.
#
# See also: `OPENCMISS_IRON_ONLY`_ and `OPENCMISS_DEPENDENCIES_ONLY`_
#
# .. default:: FALSE
OPENCMISS_ZINC_ONLY;FALSE;BOOL;Only build the Zinc library.

##
# OPENCMISS_IRON_ONLY
# -------------------
#
# Set this to true to only build the Iron library.  OPENCMISS_ZINC_ONLY and OPENCMISS_DEPENDENCIES_ONLY
# must be FALSE if this variable is set to TRUE.
#
# See also: `OPENCMISS_ZINC_ONLY`_ and `OPENCMISS_DEPENDENCIES_ONLY`_
#
# .. default:: FALSE
OPENCMISS_IRON_ONLY;FALSE;BOOL;Only build the Iron library.

##
# OPENCMISS_DEPENDENCIES_ONLY
# ---------------------------
#
# Set this to true to only build the Zinc library.  OPENCMISS_IRON_ONLY and OPENCMISS_ZINC_ONLY
# must be FALSE if this variable is set to TRUE.
#
# See also: `OPENCMISS_IRON_ONLY`_ and `OPENCMISS_ZINC_ONLY`_
#
# .. default:: FALSE
OPENCMISS_DEPENDENCIES_ONLY;FALSE;BOOL;Only build the dependencies for OpenCMISS libraries.
