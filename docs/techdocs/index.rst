File System Layout
==================
The top level folder subsequently called :var:`OPENCMISS_ROOT` is the base folder for the build environment.
Its subfolders are as follows:

::

   build/                                       # Root for all build trees
      [arch-dir-short/]mpi/                     # Root for local MPI builds
         openmpi
         mpich
      [arch-dir/]                               # Architecture path including toolchain, mpi, multithreading, ...

The main setup project organization
===================================
The setup project is the main access point for OpenCMISS builds and shows the following
structure (mounted on :path:`OPENCMISS_ROOT/manage/`):

::

   CMakeLists.txt                               # Main CMake build config file.
   Config/                                      # A collection of CMake files regarding the configuration of the build process
   CMakeScripts/                                # A collection of scripts performing a specific task. Merely created for tidyness and separation of concerns.
      CMakeCheck.cmake
      OCSetupBuildMacros.cmake
      ...
   CMakeFindModuleWrappers/                     # Own wrappers for find_package() calls in OpenCMISS
      FindXXX.cmake
   CMakeModules/                                # Own provided MODULE mode search scripts
      FindSUNDIALS.cmake
      ...
   Templates/                                   # Files that are configured at some stage of the configuration or build phase
      OpenCMISSLocalConfig.template.cmake
      ...

Examples structure
==================
Similar to the old build system, the examples available for OpenCMISS are kept separate. 
Ultimately, all the available examples will be hosted in their own GIT repository,
and a central examples repository will collect all working examples for any OpenCMISS release.
In the process of conversion, however, there still only exists one global
examples repository (initialized with the old examples svn repo) 
at https://github.com/OpenCMISS-Examples/examples, branch “v1.0”.
 
The current global project can generate the :path:`CMakeLists.txt` files automatically
(not very clever though) for each example.
The detection is done simply via looking if the according folder contains a :path:`Makefile` file.
This is far from ideal, but a quick way to see what’s working and what not.

Writing Iron IO routines
========================

For any routine that does not directly belong to the OpenCMISS-Iron API (:sh:`opencmiss_iron.f90`), extra declarations have to be made
in order to have the according methods exported to Windows .dll files.

Within the respective source, say :sh:`test_framework_routines.f90`, you need to include::

   #include "dllexport.h"
   
to define the DLL export macro. Within each publicly visible routine, you then need to specify :code:`!DLLEXPORT(<routinename>)` as a comment inside
the routine body, e.g::

   SUBROUTINE TEST_FRAMEWORK_ASSERT_EQUALS_INTG(EXPECTED_VALUE,ACTUAL_VALUE,ERR)
    !DLLEXPORT(TEST_FRAMEWORK_ASSERT_EQUALS_INTG)
    
    !Argument variables 
    [...]
 

Building applications
=====================

If you write Fortran code and use MPI, you need to use the following MPI directives::

  #ifndef NOMPIMOD
    USE MPI
  #endif
  [...]
    IMPLICIT NONE
  [...]
  #ifdef NOMPIMOD
    #include "mpif.h"
  #endif

Reasoning: In some cases like Windows/MPICH2 there sometimes is no mpi.mod file. In order to yet make
the example work the build system adds the definition 'NOMPIMOD', which can be checked and acted to accordingly.
