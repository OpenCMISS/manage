OpenCMISS manage project
------------------------

This is the main project for CMake-based OpenCMISS builds.
Both OpenCMISS components Iron and Zinc can be built separately or together.
The management project also takes care of proper dependency checking and building of dependencies, if necessary.

This is the first beta-release of the new CMake-based build system.

Installation
------------

.. Inserting a toctree or including a file does not seem to work on GitHub - hence a good old text here.

Please follow the `build instructions`__.
